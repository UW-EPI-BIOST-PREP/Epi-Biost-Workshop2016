## What is the workspace?
- The workspace holds all data, functions, and objects created in a specific R session
- Can be saved as a `.Rdata` file upon quitting R
- Can be loaded at the start of a new R session

## Managing the workspace

|---|---|
`getwd()` | print the current working directory
`ls()` | list the objects in the current workspace
`setwd(mydir)` | change working directory to `mydir`
`history()` | display the last 25 commands used in the console


## Managing the workspace
Function | Purpose
|---|---|
`savehistory(file = "myfile")` | save command history to file `"myfile"` in the current working directory
`loadhistory(file = "myfile")` | load previous history
