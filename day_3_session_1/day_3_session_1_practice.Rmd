```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Putting it all together
- So far we have learned a bit of what R can accomplish
- Now it's time to try it out!

## The task
- Taking another look at the `mri` data
- Want to do the following
    1. Create a new variable, BMI, and add it to the `mri` dataset
    2. Take a quick look for any missing values, describe the people missing data
    3. Create some descriptive tables and plots
- Remember that BMI is mass (kg) divided by squared height in meters
    - We will have to do some conversions!
